# FrontEndWebDevelopment

## 1. Platform Structure  
A simple multi-page app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Each page (section) will cover a topic (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) with lessons, code snippets, and exercises.  

## Step-by-Step Code Explanations:  

### 1. HTML Structure:
The ```<header>``` contains the platform title and navigation buttons.
The ```<main>``` section houses the course content, divided into ```<section>``` elements for HTML, CSS, and JS.
Each lesson is an ```<article>```, with code snippets and explanations.
The ```<footer>``` provides resource links for further study.  

### 2. CSS Styling:
Sets font, colors, backgrounds, and responsive styles.
Navigation buttons change color on hover.
Main content is centered and styled for readability.
Code blocks have a light background and rounded corners.  

### 3. JavaScript Interactivity:
```showSection(sectionId)```: Shows the selected section and hides others for dynamic navigation.
Syntax highlighting uses simple regex replacements for demo readability.  

## Tips, Tricks & Hints
### Use Live Server:  
Install the [Live Server extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) in VSCode for real-time browser reloads.
### Experiment:  
Modify the code snippets, break things, and rebuild to deepen understanding.
### Practice, Practice, Practice:  
Code along with the lessons and try the exercises before looking at the solutions.
### Use Browser DevTools:  
Inspect elements, test CSS, and debug JavaScript directly in your browser.
